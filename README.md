## Cryptography

This is a small project with the goal of learning a few cryptography algorithms.
Here you'll find some implementations and notes about each one of them.

### Symmetric crypto systems
- Caesar cipher
- Vigenere cipher
- One time Pad
- DES 
- AES

### Asymmetric crypto systems
- RSA
- ECC
